# CO2-Emission-Prediction

Predictive Machine Learning (ML) models and the big amount of available data can be very useful to analyze the development of climate change trends or relevant contributors. In theory, the country emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 over a year could depend on certain country-specific aspects. In this context, I have developed a ML project aiming to analyze and predict CO2 emissions by vehicle dataset.
For this purpose, I have used the publicly available dataset from Kaggle below Is the dataset link.
This dataset contains official record of CO2 emissions data by various car of different features.
There are total 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are few abbreviations that has been used to describe the features. Those are listed in the Data Description sheet.
